# Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

- 📚 Currently studying at **HEC Lausanne**
- 💡 Passionate about working on **personal projects** (not only coding ones!)
- 💻 Exploring new technologies and ideas, always learning something new
- 🛠️ Focused on **problem-solving** and creativity in both tech and non-tech fields

## Tech Stack
I'm currently working with **React** and **TypeScript**. Here's a bit about why I love using these:

- ⚛️ **React**: I enjoy building dynamic and interactive UIs. React's component-based architecture makes development efficient and fun.
- 🔷 **TypeScript**: Strong typing and improved tooling make TypeScript a go-to for writing clean, maintainable code. It helps catch errors early and makes collaboration smoother.

Feel free to explore my repositories and see what I've been working on. I'm always open to feedback, collaborations, or just a friendly chat. Let's connect and create something amazing together!
